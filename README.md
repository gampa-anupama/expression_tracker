# expression_tracker
This project is a MERN stack-based project designed to evaluate the effectiveness of educational games for dyslexic children. By tracking facial expressions during gameplay, the system helps developers, therapists, and educators gain insights into how children interact with games, identifying challenges and refining educational tools.
